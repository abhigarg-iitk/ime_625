#Application of graph theory in Markov Chain
This repository contains code for course project ime625.
## Problem Statement for the project

We tried to apply various graph theoretic algorithms to markov chain. 
### Project Details
* To run the code we must input transition matrix of the markov chain to this code. This matrix is to be written in matrix file.
* To run the code we must run driver.m
* Other details can be found in readme.pdf
